# Eagler Common Runtime

Shared runtime infrastructure for Eagler Touhou ports.

License: MIT.

This directory is the single source of truth for code that is independent of a
specific Touhou title. Game repositories keep adapters for title-owned state;
once a shared authority is adopted, consumers include it directly rather than
keeping forwarding headers or forking the algorithm back into title code.

## Ownership boundary

Good common-library candidates:

- netplay protocol/session/core algorithms;
- transport and browser networking;
- rollback journals and fixed-pool snapshot primitives;
- generic input scheduling/prediction/repair;
- fixed-step/browser lifecycle helpers;
- diagnostics and performance-test primitives.

`testkit/presentation-lab/controller-core.mjs` is the shared orchestration
authority for draw-only alpha inspection and fixed-tick fast-forward. Games
retain adapters for their record layouts, owner identities, state fingerprints
and classification policy; production builds do not expose those diagnostics.

Keep title-specific:

- rollback state inventory and object layout;
- canonical hashes of title-owned state;
- Bullet/Enemy/ECL/Stage/Bomb ownership rules;
- native Replay format semantics;
- title-specific gameplay lifecycle adapters.

The rule is: **share algorithms and infrastructure, not object layouts**.

## Shared testkits

The optional [`eagler::input_replay`](docs/input-replay.md) target supplies a
bounded transactional all-seat file codec. Titles own their metadata, native
record/playback lifecycle, storage and compatibility gates. The additive
`RollbackCore::ConfirmedInputs` fence does not export predictions or replace
title-state validation.

The repository publishes source-level testkits that consumers pin and import
directly. They are normal development infrastructure, not production Runtime
features:

| Component | Stable source contract | Consumers | Normal gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Presentation Lab](testkit/presentation-lab/README.md) | driver/observation v1 | TH08; limited TH10 adapter | `node --test testkit/presentation-lab/controller-core.test.mjs testkit/presentation-lab/release-contract.test.mjs` |
| [Replay verifier](testkit/replay-verifier/README.md) | trace/report v1 | TH08, TH10 | see its README |

Presentation Lab freezes a title at fixed-tick boundaries, performs draw-only
alpha sweeps and classifies normalized evidence without changing production
game logic. Common owns orchestration, contracts and title-neutral analysis;
each game owns its native diagnostic ABI, state coverage and object semantics.
TH06 and TH07 do not currently advertise Lab support because their draw chains
have not yet met the repeated-draw purity boundary.

The cross-title Replay verification contract, comparator, JSONL transport and
tests live in [`testkit/replay-verifier`](testkit/replay-verifier/). The
architecture and per-title rollout are specified in the
[Replay verifier plan](docs/replay-verifier-plan.md).

## Migration policy

Migration is intentionally incremental.  Extract exact duplicates first, prove
both games still pass their existing gates, then converge near-duplicates.  Do
not combine common-library extraction with gameplay-state or protocol changes in
the same step.

Validated convergence slices in the current shared source line:

- `NetplaySession`
- `WebSocketTransport`
- `NetplayProtocol`
- `NetplayCore`
- `RollbackJournal`
- generic rollback primitives: `SnapshotPolicy`, `SparsePoolCapture`,
  `PartitionedPoolJournal`
- `BrowserPeerTransport`
- `NetplayInput`
- incremental DirectTouch primitives: `DirectTouchBegin` / `DirectTouchDelta`,
  `DirectTouchState`, delayed capture mapping and conservative delta prediction
- bounded reliable input repair primitives: `InputRepairBudget` and
  `BrowserPeerTransport::SendRepairTo`
- DirectTouch equivalence proof plus explicit Core APIs for title adapters to
  confirm an already-simulated predicted input after proving state equivalence
- allocation-free per-peer frame-advantage smoothing with the shared
  64-sample trimmed-mean policy used by TH06/TH07
- browser catch-up `FrameBudget` preserving the validated six-tick cap plus an
  8 ms wall-time boundary for starting additional fixed ticks
- shared frame-pacing formula preserving the long-lived TH06/TH07 lead filter,
  deadband, ±2% clamp and smoothing constants
- confirmed-input liveness watchdog preserving the long-lived 15-second
  production peer-progress timeout while allowing title test harness overrides
- aggregate confirmed-remote frontier directly from `RollbackCore`, so room
  drivers do not duplicate sentinel/minimum semantics
- explicit simulation-frontier retirement after title state restoration,
  preserving captured input, confirmation and peer ACK history

### Corrected lifecycle and bidirectional frontiers (0.15.0)

`RollbackCore::RewindSimulationTo(firstFrame)` is called **after** the title has
restored the state immediately before that frame. It removes simulated/used
decisions from that frame onward and lowers `LastSimulatedFrame`, but retains
once-captured local inputs, confirmed remote inputs, and ACK/retransmission
state. Resimulation can stop at an earlier corrected lifecycle boundary without
retaining phantom simulated frames from an abandoned future.

It rejects absent/expired/non-contiguous decision history, a frame after the
last simulation, and skipping an earlier rollback request. Validation is
transactional. It does not restore title memory, retire a network generation,
or certify the title's snapshot coverage.

`AcknowledgedLocalThrough(peer)` and `AcknowledgedLocalThroughAllRemotes()`
expose how much **our input** peers have acknowledged. This differs from
`ConfirmedThroughAllRemotes()`, remote input **we have received**. Drivers must
handle both directions and the final-ACK/tail retransmission race before
abandoning an old run's wire history. Unconfigured/missing-peer frontiers use
`INVALID_FRAME`, never an implicit large confirmed frame.

`tests/simulation-frontier-test.cpp` covers 2P/3P, retained analog samples,
unchanged encoded retransmission/ACK payloads, partial resimulation, frame zero,
history wrap/expiry, missing decisions, and transactional rejection. Existing
callers which do not use these additive APIs keep their prior behavior; the
wire protocol and title configuration seams are unchanged.

### Transport session lifecycle (0.15.0)

`eagler::session_channel` adds `SessionChannel` over a small `PeerTransport`
interface. `BrowserPeerTransport` implements that interface; titles still own
their `SessionGate`, `RollbackCore`, input capture, world restoration and every
logical update. This is not a universal game driver or a second simulation.

The channel pumps the existing HELLO/READY protocol, peer-relative input/ACK
packets, bounded reliable tail repairs and confirmation liveness independently
of whether gameplay can advance. A run may retire only after reconciliation and
both input directions have reached its terminal frame. Its terminal ACK remains
answerable while the next generation negotiates, until every peer's new HELLO
proves that peer has also retired the old generation. Old-session traffic cannot
advance the new core. Relay uses its reliable targeted route when an RTC repair
lane is absent. `Clear()` is a full owner teardown, not a generation transition.

`RollbackCore::ApplyInputPacket` validates the complete packet before changing
any input, ACK or rollback frontier. Conflicting redundant samples, invalid
analog values, impossible ACKs and destructive future ring-slot collisions
reject transactionally. Benign expired retransmissions retain their prior
`TooOld` result. `IsValidFrameInput` exposes the decoder's existing title seam
for adapters; the wire encoding remains version 4.

`tests/session-channel-test.cpp` covers a lossy three-peer stream, a missed
READY, bounded handshake/liveness failure, reliable repair with a fully lost
fast lane, and final-ACK loss while the faster peer starts a fresh generation.
`tests/packet-transaction-test.cpp` checks exact unchanged core bytes after
rejection. Consumer browser evidence is separate from these algorithm tests.

### Functional baseline before optimization

The TH08/TH10 multiplayer completion work first closes the entire multiplayer
functional/correctness profile and records an independently verified ordinary
single-player baseline. Performance work is deferred until that boundary is
committed. Any later optimization that also affects ordinary gameplay receives
its own commits and both single-player and multiplayer regression evidence;
do not mix it with feature bring-up or update goldens to explain a divergence.

`NetplaySession` and `WebSocketTransport` were byte-identical before extraction.
`NetplayProtocol` differs only through a deliberately tiny title-owned wire
capability seam (`NetplayProtocolConfig.hpp`): the game magic byte and maximum
supported analog mode. The shared
Protocol header and `NetplayCore` preserve the behavior of the current TH06 and
TH07 `eagler` branches exactly; newer uncommitted title experiments are not
folded into this authority migration.

`RollbackJournal` moved only after TH06 completed its measured optimization pass
against the TH07 playbook. The shared implementation preserves TH06's validated
allocation/index/copy/restore behavior and the TH07-only snapshot-patch API used
by its once-only DirectTouch equivalence path. Pool layout remains title-owned;
only the generic storage algorithms live here.

`BrowserPeerTransport` was byte-identical between TH06 and TH07 after replacing
only the title tag (`th06`/`th07`). The shared implementation keeps that tag as
the tiny title-owned `NetplayTransportConfig.hpp` seam so existing DataChannel
labels and legacy browser globals remain stable. Bounded reliable repair is now
part of this shared transport authority; broader performance telemetry remains
a separate concern with its own acceptance criteria.

`NetplayInput.hpp` was byte-identical between TH06 and TH07. Their implementation
also becomes byte-identical after removing TH06's legacy `Multiplayer.hpp`
player-count alias. The shared implementation therefore uses protocol
`MAX_PLAYERS` and delegates only the title-owned synchronized gameplay-lane
writeback to `NetplayInputConfig.hpp::CommitGameInputs()`.

The shared once-only DirectTouch model captures device displacement once as
`DirectTouchBegin` / `Delta`,
unapplied limited-speed movement lives in rewindable `DirectTouchState`, and
`RollbackCore::LocalFrameForCapture()` makes delayed scheduling addressable
without re-sampling the producer. Prediction is conservative by default: a
missing delta contributes zero new displacement. Equivalent-prediction
acceptance, browser catch-up budgeting and performance telemetry remain
separate authorities.

Reliable input repair is deliberately not a second input transport. Normal RTC
input remains unordered/unreliable. After the first unacknowledged input frame
has made no progress for `InputRepairBudget::StalledMs`, a consumer may send the
already-captured redundant packet through that peer's reliable control channel.
Healthy ACK progress produces zero repair traffic; control-channel backpressure
simply skips an attempt and does not fail the gameplay transport.

The shared `testkit/rtc-input-impairment.cjs` fixture can delay, jitter, drop or
black out the real RTC input DataChannel while giving reliable repair traffic
the same artificial application-send delay. Title harnesses provide their
input/control channel labels; the fixture contains no TH06/TH07 product policy.

DirectTouch equivalence is deliberately adapter-proven rather than inferred by
`RollbackCore`. The shared proof accepts only a narrow, saturated single-axis
limited-touch correction that cannot cross a movement boundary or gesture
reset. A title must provide the historical applied/remaining trace and patch
its own rollback snapshots before calling `SubmitEquivalentRemoteInput()`.
That commit API has a dedicated result type; `NotPredicted` is distinct from an
invalid player and from ordinary packet-processing results so adapters cannot
silently confuse a failed equivalence precondition with transport input state.

`FrameAdvantageWindow` is shared because the measured TH06 and TH07 algorithms
are the same: each peer owns an independent 64-sample ring, waits for 20
samples, trims up to four values from each tail and averages the remainder.
The shared form removes the per-packet temporary vector allocation. The
independent pacing formula is owned by `FramePacingPolicy`; peer membership,
sample de-duplication and telemetry remain in the consumer driver.

`FrameBudget` is not an input-delay mode. It governs browser event-loop
ownership after a callback is already behind: one due tick always runs, then
additional catch-up ticks may start only while the validated 8 ms wall-time
budget and six-tick cap allow it. Remaining accumulator debt is retained for a
later callback. This preserves the production TH07 policy and lets TH06 share
the same scheduler rule without adding local input frames.

`FramePacingPolicy` is also nondeterministic scheduling support, not gameplay
state. TH06 and TH07 have used the same policy since their original multiplayer
drivers: infer relative lead from frame-advantage exchange, reject samples past
30 frames, apply a 0.5-frame deadband, target 1.0 + lead*0.003 clamped to
0.98..1.02, smooth by 0.08 and snap within 0.0002 of unity. Peer membership,
packet de-duplication, telemetry and diagnostic disable switches stay title-owned.

`ConfirmedInputWatchdog` likewise owns no room lifecycle. Once a title decides
a remote peer is required and the session is active, it observes that peer's
confirmed input frontier and reports a timeout only after the frontier remains
unchanged for 15 seconds. Disarming, choosing a longer hidden-test timeout and
turning the timeout into a visible room failure remain title responsibilities.

`RollbackCore::ConfirmedThroughAllRemotes()` owns the aggregate frontier
because the core already owns player count, local-player identity and each
peer's confirmation state. It returns `INVALID_FRAME` until every remote has
confirmed input, then the minimum remote frontier. Replay, spectator and shared
UI policy built on that frontier remain title-owned.

## Current extraction stop line

The v0.13 candidate intentionally stops before a shared title driver.
TH06/TH07 still contain several byte-identical orchestration functions for
session retry, packet drain, spectator publication and scheduled input send.
Those functions compose many already-shared authorities plus title/session
state; extracting them now would effectively design a universal
`NetplayDriver` from only two closely related consumers.

Do **not** create v0.14 merely to remove that orchestration duplication. Reopen
the driver boundary when TH08/TH10 multiplayer or another third production
consumer exists and can validate the interface shape.

`RollbackReplayBudget` is retained as a shared **experimental primitive**
because the TH07 performance work already used the same generic 4 ms /
four-frame slicing rule. It remains opt-in incremental-reconcile infrastructure:
the Launcher does not enable it, it is not an input-delay mode, and it must not
be presented as part of the production timing profile. A second production
consumer is still required before replay-slicing becomes a shared product
policy. Broader diagnostics/testkit work may move independently when it is
title-neutral and already proven reusable.

## Convergence order

Use this order unless new evidence proves a dependency requires otherwise:

1. exact duplicates: `NetplaySession`, `WebSocketTransport`;
2. near-identical wire/core code: `NetplayProtocol`, `NetplayCore`;
3. generic storage: `RollbackJournal` plus fixed-pool/sparse snapshot helpers;
4. browser transport: `BrowserPeerTransport`;
5. generic input authority: `NetplayInput`;
6. once-only incremental DirectTouch and delayed capture mapping;
7. bounded reliable input repair;
8. DirectTouch equivalence;
9. allocation-free per-peer frame-advantage smoothing;
10. browser catch-up start budget;
11. shared frame-pacing formula;
12. confirmed-input peer liveness watchdog;
13. aggregate confirmed-remote frontier;
14. **stop and validate with a third production consumer before extracting
    driver orchestration**;
15. independently share proven title-neutral performance testkit/diagnostics;
16. only then reconsider broader platform/presentation helpers.

Every step must leave TH06 and TH07 buildable and testable independently. A
consumer may advance to a newer common implementation only after its own
title-specific rollback/canonical gates pass. Do not make a common refactor and
a gameplay-state change in the same acceptance step.

## Version/authority rule

`eagler-common` is the implementation authority. Mature shared authorities are
included directly from `<eagler/netplay/...>`; consumers must not reintroduce
title-local forwarding headers or marker `.cpp` files for those names. Keep
only genuine title-owned seams such as `NetplayProtocolConfig.hpp`,
`NetplayTransportConfig.hpp`, `NetplayInputConfig.hpp`, canonical hashes,
rollback state owners and game drivers.

The canonical published layout uses a pinned `third_party/eagler-common` Git
submodule in each game repository, pointing at `YomotsuHisami/eagler-common`.
The workspace sibling remains a development fallback and an explicit
`EAGLER_COMMON_ROOT` override remains available for controlled experiments.

Consumers link `eagler::netplay_base` for Protocol/Core and may independently
link `eagler::browser_peer_transport` and `eagler::netplay_input`. These remain
INTERFACE components so shared sources compile with the consumer's platform
toolchain and title-owned config seams. Protocol uses
`<netplay/NetplayProtocolConfig.hpp>` for wire capability; browser transport
uses `<netplay/NetplayTransportConfig.hpp>` only for its stable title tag; input
uses `<netplay/NetplayInputConfig.hpp>` only to commit synchronized logical
buttons into title-owned gameplay lanes.

Do not push a consumer commit that requires the common library until the common
repository/revision it names is available remotely. CI/release builds must pin
an exact common commit; they must never fetch an unpinned branch head.

The dependency version is the exact Git commit recorded by the consumer
submodule. Presentation Lab's API major describes source-contract
compatibility; it does not replace that reproducible commit identity. Breaking
shared-runtime changes must be validated against every consumer before
advancing those gitlinks.

## Standalone validation

`eagler-common` has a minimal consumer fixture so the repository can validate
its current component contract without checking out a Touhou game repository:

```text
cmake -S . -B build -DEAGLER_COMMON_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

The TH06/TH07 workspace integration contract remains a separate gate because
it validates real consumer shims, CMake wiring and full Web builds.
